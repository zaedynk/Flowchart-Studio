# Flowchart-Studio is a versatile tool that allows you to visualize and convert C++ code into flowcharts and vice versa. It simplifies the process of understanding and documenting complex C++ code by providing a graphical representation of the code's flow and structure.
Features

    Flowchart Visualization: Easily generate flowcharts from your C++ code to visualize the logic and control flow of your program.

    C++ Code Generation: Create C++ code from flowcharts, making it a handy tool for reverse engineering or code generation tasks.

    Intuitive Interface: The user-friendly interface provides a visual workspace for designing flowcharts and viewing the code.

    Hierarchical Structure: Organize your code and flowcharts in a hierarchical manner to maintain a clear structure.

    Import Directories: Import entire directories of C++ files for batch processing and visualization.
